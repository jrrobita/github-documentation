# workflow for synching forked repo with changes in upstream 'source' repo

- fork the source repo to your org (or anywhere you write permission) from the github gui

- clone the fored repo to your local computer
- copy the https / ssh location of your forked remote repo 

- in a destination folder of your local computer open git bash
- enter:
git clone <location of your forked remote repo>

- move into the folder you just created containing the cloned repo using: cd + name of new folder
cd <name of new folder>

-check that current location is correct using any of:
pwd				# prints working directoy
ls				# lists all files / folders in the current working dirctory 
git stauts		# returns the status of the git repo you are currently in (or an error if you are not in a git repo)

- set the original remote source repo as the upstream location for your local repo
- go to the original remote source repo on github and copy the the https / ssh location
- in git bash enter:
git remote add upstream <location of the orig source repo>

- to verify that the orig source was added as the upstream fro your lcoal repo enter:
git remote -v

- this will return the remote origin (for the associated remote forked repo) and upstream (for the orig source repo)
- now you can pull (proper verbage: 'synch') changes from the orig source repo to your local copy of the forked repo

- to sych changes from the orig source repo enter the following in git bash:
 
 git fetch upstream			# gets conent of orig soucre repo
 git checkout master		# puts you on master branch in your local repo if you have multiple branches
 git merge upstream/master	# merges changes from upstream orig source repo to the master branch of your local copy of the forked repo
 
 - then finally - if deisred - you can push those synched changes fro the source repo to the remote version of the forked repo on github
 git push origin
